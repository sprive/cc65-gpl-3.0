gpl-3.0-c64
===========

Contained here is a copy of the GNU Public License, version 3.0 in a form that can be displayed directly on computers that are
targetable with the CC65 6502 cross-compiler (http://github.com/cc65/cc65). By default, the Makefile generates a Commodore 64
binary with the soft80 conio driver, and the output is assumed to be 80 columns.

The output is paginated for an 80x25 display.

It is hoped that this can be used by projects compiled with CC65 so that a copy of the license can be placed on any
distribution media, in compliance with the aforementioned license. I hope you all find it useful.
